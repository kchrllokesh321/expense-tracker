# Deployment Summary

## 📁 Files Created/Modified

### GitHub Actions Workflow
- `.github/workflows/build-and-deploy.yml` - Main CI/CD pipeline
- `.github/workflows/build-and-deploy-kubeconfig.yml.disabled` - Alternative method (disabled)

### Documentation
- `CI-CD-SETUP.md` - Complete setup guide
- `DEPLOYMENT-SUMMARY.md` - This summary

### Helper Scripts
- `deploy.sh` - Manual deployment script
- `health-check.sh` - Application health check

### Modified Files
- `deployment.yaml` - Fixed secret name and updated image tag
- `README.md` - Added CI/CD section

## 🔧 Required GitHub Secrets

Configure these in your GitHub repository (`Settings` > `Secrets and variables` > `Actions`):

1. **DOCKER_PASSWORD** - Your Docker Hub access token
2. **SSH_PRIVATE_KEY** - SSH private key for server access

## 🚀 How It Works

### Automatic Deployment (Push to main/master)
1. GitHub Actions triggers on push
2. Builds React app with npm
3. Creates Docker image with automatic tagging
4. Pushes to Docker Hub (`lokesh86186/react`)
5. SSH into server (45.129.86.68)
6. Applies Kubernetes manifests
7. Waits for deployment completion

### Manual Deployment
```bash
# Deploy with default settings
./deploy.sh

# Deploy specific version to specific server
./deploy.sh v1.2.3 45.129.86.68
```

### Health Check
```bash
# Check deployment status
./health-check.sh

# Check specific server
./health-check.sh 45.129.86.68
```

## 🏷️ Image Tags

The workflow creates these Docker image tags:
- `latest` (main/master branch only)
- `main-<commit-sha>` or `master-<commit-sha>`
- `<branch-name>` (feature branches)
- `pr-<number>` (pull requests)

## 🔍 Monitoring

### Via Kubernetes
```bash
kubectl get pods -l app=expense-app
kubectl get svc expense-app-service
kubectl logs -l app=expense-app
```

### Via Scripts
```bash
./health-check.sh  # Automated health check
```

## 🛡️ Security Notes

- SSH key should have minimal permissions
- Use dedicated deployment user instead of root (recommended)
- Docker Hub credentials should be access tokens, not passwords
- Regularly rotate secrets

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Configure the GitHub repository secrets
2. Add your SSH public key to the server
3. Push code to main/master branch
4. Monitor deployment in GitHub Actions
5. Access your app via the NodePort service

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

If deployment fails:

1. Check GitHub Actions logs
2. Verify secrets are correctly configured
3. Ensure SSH access to server works
4. Run health check script
5. Check Kubernetes resources manually

For detailed troubleshooting, see `CI-CD-SETUP.md`.
